# LocalCord

LocalCord is a privacy-focused Discord-inspired app, that is made with love and silly thoughts. The main idea behind LocalCord is that the host is also the client and vice versa, meaning servers are hosted locally using the WebSocket (WS) library. This approach ensures a higher level of privacy and control over data.

## Features

- **Privacy Focused**: With LocalCord, your data stays on your local machine.
- **Local Hosting**: Servers are hosted locally using the WebSocket (WS) library.
- **User Friendly**: Easy to set up and use.
